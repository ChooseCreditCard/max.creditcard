    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Maxing Out: More Than Just Hitting the Number</h2>
      <p>
        To “max out” a credit card usually means using all, or nearly all, of the available credit limit.
        On paper it is simply a number: a limit, and a current balance that has reached it. In practice,
        it often comes with fees, higher interest costs, less breathing room and more mental load.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page does not tell you what to do with your own credit – it instead explains concepts like
        utilisation, buffers and why some lenders look carefully at how close you tend to stay to your limits.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Utilisation -->
    <section id="utilisation" class="section">
      <h2>Credit Utilisation and Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        A common way to describe how “full” a card is, is the utilisation rate – the balance divided by the
        credit limit, expressed as a percentage.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Low utilisation:</strong> using only a small part of your limit can signal more flexibility
          and room to handle surprises.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>High utilisation:</strong> staying close to the limit for long periods can signal strain or
          reliance on revolving debt, even if payments are on time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spikes vs. patterns:</strong> a brief spike close to the maximum can mean something different
          from always being near or above the limit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Different credit systems and countries treat utilisation in different ways, but many score models pay
        attention both to individual-card utilisation and total utilisation across all cards.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks & habits -->
    <section id="risks" class="section">
      <h2>Risks of Living at the Limit</h2>
      <p>
        Being near the maximum limit is not only about algorithms. It also affects day-to-day life:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Less room for emergencies or unexpected expenses.</li>
        <li>Higher interest costs if you cannot pay the full statement each month.</li>
        <li>Higher risk of over-limit fees or declined transactions if something posts later than expected.</li>
        <li>More stress when checking balances, which can impact other financial decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some people choose to treat their “real” personal limit as lower than the official limit – for example by
        keeping a buffer they try not to cross, or by using a separate card for travel or online purchases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Using limits thoughtfully -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Using Credit Limits in a Thoughtful Way</h2>
      <p>
        Credit limits are not inherently good or bad – they are tools. A higher limit can provide flexibility,
        but only if it is paired with habits that keep balances under control. A smaller limit can act as a
        guardrail, but may also be restrictive if you travel or face large irregular expenses.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some people track utilisation as a simple percentage to stay within a self-chosen comfort range.</li>
        <li>Others spread spending across more than one card to avoid maxing one single line.</li>
        <li>Some use alerts or apps to get notified when balances cross a threshold.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        None of these are one-size-fits-all solutions, but they illustrate ways to think about limits beyond
        just “how high can I go?”.
